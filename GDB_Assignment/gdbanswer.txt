//How I found s using gdb: (binary search)

$ gdb oops     #step-1: opening with gdb

$ break 16      #step-2: adding break  point at line 16 where r=f(n) is gonna be executed

$ run 21CS10073      #step-3: running the program with my roll no

$set var n=15000     #step-4: changing value of variable n to find our answer

$ continue              #step-5: continue to the end of program where result f(n) will be printed

//now after executing these five steps, check the value of f(n) which is f(15000) here,

// if f(15000)==1 -> check in (10000,15000) for s

//else if f(15000)==0 -> check in (15000,20000) for s

//we have to repeat the steps 3,4,5 where in step 4 we'll modify the value of n depending upon the value of previous f(n)

//by this method I've got s to be 18931

$ quit    #step-6: quitting after finding our s
